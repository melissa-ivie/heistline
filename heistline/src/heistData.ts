    description: `
        A sleepy town in the Midwest is being slowly poisoned. The megacorp Nexacore Industries has been covertly dumping experimental solvents into the municipal water supply under the guise of agricultural runoff treatment.

        A junior analyst—Eli Marsh—discovered the contamination and attempted to alert federal agencies. Now he's on the move with digital copies of internal toxicology reports.

        Intercepted communications indicate Nexacore is planning to sabotage Eli’s flight before he can deliver the evidence. Your team must move fast.

        Mission Objectives:
        - Prevent the plane from taking off or ensure it lands safely.
        - Recover the original water contamination report from Nexacore’s buried R&D archive.
        - Trace internal communications and extract the CEO’s incriminating email.
        - Deliver the files anonymously to the FDA and FBI without leaving a digital trail.

        Time is running out — and the town doesn’t know it’s dying yet.

        An experimental encryption key is being held in a secure vault underneath the Manhattan Modern Museum — disguised as an art exhibit. 

        Your job? Get in during a blackout, avoid detection, extract the key, and get out before sunrise.

        Mission Objectives:
        - Disable the museum’s silent alarm grid.
        - Locate and retrieve the device without triggering the exhibit sensor.
        - Escape using the underground courier tunnel.
