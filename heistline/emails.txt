Subject: Great Sitting with You

Hi David,

I just wanted to say I really enjoyed sitting next to you at the gala. That was one of the better conversations I’ve had at one of these events — especially the discussion about the Q2 projections and your thoughts on the expansion strategy.

Let’s pick that up sometime when we’re not competing with the dessert course.

Best,
Alfred

Subject: Jeannie & Gene Were Adorable!

Hi Dr. Riddle!!

I don’t know if you noticed, but Jeannie and Gene were holding hands almost the entire night — it was the sweetest thing. At one point I leaned over and whispered to someone that Gene’s left hand was looking pale by the first hour from all that devoted hand-holding!

It’s so rare to see that kind of affection at a corporate gala. It honestly made my evening.

Hope you had as much fun as I did!

Warmly,
Susie

Subject: The Note Passing Incident

Hi Alfred,

Did you see when David tried to pass a note to Eugene? I couldn’t believe he had to convince both Susan and Michelle to pass it down the line before it finally reached him. It was like a middle school classroom for a moment there.

Wasn’t that crazy? I’m still curious what the note even said.

Best regards,
Kirsten Riddle

Subject: A Small Observation

Hi Michelle,

I noticed something interesting about how everyone ended up positioned last night — each woman was seated next to exactly one other woman.

I doubt anyone else paid attention to it, but it stood out to me. Funny how those little patterns emerge.

Best,
Jeannie

Subject: Across the Table?! Bold Move, Jeannie!

Jeannie!!!

Okay. I HAVE to ask.

Daryl Fowler sitting directly across from Michelle this year instead of next to her?? At a Nexacore gala of all places?? You cannot tell me that wasn’t intentional. After all the whispers about “internal optics”, it felt… pointed.

Half the table looked like they were watching a tennis match every time one of them spoke.

Are they just above the usual married-couple seating thing? Either way, it was spicy.

Call me immediately.
